- 👋 Hi, I’m Ed Hammerbeck
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. I have been a developer in the ERP space for 20+ years focused primarily on systems integration and middleware -- first in SAP using ABAP and now in Oracle SOA Suite. I also do some web development using Java Server Faces (JSF.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, GitHub, and NodeJS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... something... eventually.
- 📫 How to reach me: @edhammerbeck most everywhere.
